# Date Night (Web App)

## The app
Date night helps couples remember why they first fell in love, and it lays the foundation for reigniting passion. Regular date nights also help to build resilience to carry your marriage relationship during the challenging times. Now couple can share their date night ideas and read ideas from other couples.

## User Story

The user needs something to spark their brain on what to do this Friday Night so they use the web application date night so they can find ideas.

The user thinks some of the ideas on the app need some updating so they decide to add whats missing to the existing date idea. Or they can just add their version of that dat night idea

## Approach
Before I wrote any code I used Mock flow to draft a wire frame for how i wanted my page to look. I then thought about what problem could this app have that all people struggle with and the idea of date night popped up. People always need  little inspiration and this app could help with that. Before I coded my first route I created my seed data so I could have something to populate on the page. After that I created my routes starting with index page. I wanted to have a map shown in my show page so I had to research several resources to help me accomplish this. Although the maps show there is still more to be done with the map.Once I was able to get all of my routes working thats when I started to style the webpage. I decide to use Materialize for styling because I never used ot before and I figure now was the best time. 

## Challenges
Using Materialize was not as easy as using bootstrap. Somethings are pretty straight forward but other things are not. For instance when I wanted to using some the JS components I couldn't figure out what to do based on the examples they gave. The sliding carousel wouldn't show on my page even when I literally copied exactly what they had on the site. For some reason I had a hard time trying to return data from an array of objects out of my schema. I ultimately changed it to just a object and with the help of my instructor i was finally able to get it to show up. The map showing on each page depending on the address of the date night is still work in progress. I was only able to put a marker on one location.


## Notes to myself
I want to give users the ability to rate the date ideas on the app using a five star system. That way they can filter the app to see five star ratings only. I also want to eventually have the date ideas filtered by states so people anywhere can find ideas. I want user to be able to see a google map of the date idea they clicked. Instead of having a delete route users can click on i want them to maybe vote on the worst date night ideas for them to be removed from the page
